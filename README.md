# MIE562

# Implemented

1. CPM (multiroot and multileaf)

cpm.py + cpm.csv

2. Minimal cut sets finding (3 as max size of subset, 1 root for examination for now)

minimal_cutset.py + cpm.csv

3. Linear tradeoffs heuristic (minimal sets reduction)

trade_heuristic.py + cpm.csv

4. Circle identification in directional graph

loopid.py + disp.csv

5. JSP - Resource constraint (3 resources, using circle directional trials)

circle.py + patch.csv

for versatile models, refer to P2.2

6. EDD - Single machine, assignment 1

edd.py, coding1.py(without external modules)

7. Dispatch rule (SPT)

spt.py
